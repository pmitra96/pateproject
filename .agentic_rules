# PateProject Agentic Rules

- **API Verification**: After building or modifying a backend API endpoint, always use a `curl` command (or similar) to test the basic "happy case" and verify the response status and payload.
- **Go Best Practices**:
    - Use `github.com/pmitra96/pateproject/logger` (structured logging with `slog`) for all application logs.
    - Prefer Go-native libraries for file processing and extraction to ensure scalability.
- **Frontend Best Practices**:
    - Use Vanilla CSS for styling.
    - Ensure all interactive elements have unique IDs for testing.
