# PateProject Agentic Rules

- **API Verification**: After building or modifying a backend API endpoint, always use a `curl` command (or similar) to test the basic "happy case" and verify the response status and payload.
- **Go Best Practices**:
    - Use `github.com/pmitra96/pateproject/logger` (structured logging with `slog`) for all application logs.
    - Prefer Go-native libraries for file processing and extraction to ensure scalability.
- **Frontend Best Practices**:
    - Use Vanilla CSS for styling.
    - Ensure all interactive elements have unique IDs for testing.
- **Sanity Check**:
    - if you identify a case that you missed dont just fix that case, make sure that you have fixed all the cases.
    make sure that your code did not cause any regressions for that use-case.

- **Feature Addition CheckList**:
    - after every feature addition, make sure to update the current_state.md file. [this is non negotiable].
